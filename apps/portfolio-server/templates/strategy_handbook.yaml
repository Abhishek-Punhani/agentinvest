  Part I. Executive Abstract: Triangulation of Value
  1.0 Overview
  - Equity investing = business ownership analysis.
  - Framework integrates Graham–Dodd safety, Fisher growth analysis, Dorsey moats.
  - Intrinsic value differs from market price; market often distorted by sentiment.
  - Focus on Margin of Safety, Scuttlebutt growth evaluation, and Moat durability.

  1.1 Investment vs. Speculation
  - Investment: thorough analysis, safety of principal, satisfactory return.
  - Safety linked to price; analysis relies on factual assets, earnings, dividends, prospects.
  - Speculation depends on price movement, not value.
  - Market bubbles stem from valuing hope over current economics.

  1.2 Intrinsic Value
  - Value justified by facts vs. emotionally driven prices.
  - Intrinsic value is a range; precision unnecessary.
  - Analyst checks if price diverges enough from value range for a Margin of Safety.
  - Bargain recognition doesn’t require exact intrinsic value.

  1.3 Hierarchy of Price Determinants
  - Market factors (technicals, sentiment): ignore except as opportunity.
  - Future factors (management, competitive outlook): verify qualitatively.
  - Intrinsic factors (earnings, dividends, assets, capital structure, rates): analyze quantitatively.

  1.4 Margin of Safety
  - Defined as discount of price vs. minimum intrinsic value.
  - Protects against forecasting errors and economic unpredictability.
  - Buying at full value offers no protection; buying at 60¢ for $1.00 gives buffer and upside.

  Part II. Quantitative Analysis: Anatomy of Safety

  2.0 Overview
  - Quantitative analysis is forensic: remove accounting noise to reveal economic substance.

  2.1 Balance Sheet Analysis
  - Balance sheet anchors safety; shows resources vs. obligations.

  2.1.1 Book Value vs. Current-Asset Value
  - Book Value unreliable due to historical cost rules and intangible distortions.
  - Use Liquidation/Current-Asset Value: current assets minus all liabilities; fixed assets assumed zero.
  - Price < Net-Current-Asset Value signals market pessimism; Net-Net portfolios historically yield strong returns if cash burn is modest.

  2.1.2 Working Capital Analysis
  - Current ratio >1.5x only meaningful if asset quality is sound.
  - Receivables growing faster than sales → credit risk or channel stuffing.
  - Slowing inventory turnover → stale inventory risk; check for earnings-smoothing reserves.
  - Verify cash accessibility (no restrictions or trapped funds).

  2.1.3 Balance Sheet Safety Thresholds
  - Current Ratio >1.5x: protects short-term solvency.
  - Price/Book <1.5x: limits overpayment for goodwill.
  - Working Capital > Long-Term Debt: lowers reliance on credit markets.
  - Price < Net Current Assets: deep value; extreme pessimism signal.

  2.2 Income Statement: Earnings Power
  - Net Income is accounting; real focus is sustainable Earnings Power (7–10 year cycle).

  2.2.1 Normalized Earnings
  - Use multi‑year averages to avoid cyclical distortions.
  - Remove non‑recurring items; recurring “one‑time” charges are actual expenses.
  - Exclude capital gains from core earnings.

  2.2.2 Depreciation Reality Check
  - Depreciation is real capital consumption; EBITDA ignores this.
  - Maintenance CapEx > depreciation for flat revenue = under-depreciation, overstated earnings.
  - Amortization must be judged as real value loss or mere accounting.

  2.2.3 Subsidiaries and Affiliates
  - Adjust for consolidated + non‑consolidated entities; include all affiliate earnings/losses.
  - Dividends > subsidiary earnings indicate disguised capital return.

  2.3 Capital Structure
  - Equity safety depends on total debt burden; leverage raises wipeout risk.

  2.3.1 Factor of Safety
  - Times Interest Earned should be 2–3× even in worst year of decade.
  - Senior claims dominate in restructuring; heavy debt can zero out equity.

  2.3.2 Corporate Pyramiding
  - Holdco leverage magnifies downside; small declines wipe out holdco equity.
  - Evaluate consolidated, look‑through leverage across the entire structure.

  Part III. Structural Analysis: Economic Moat

  3.0 Overview
  - After quantitative safety, assess durability of earnings via economic moats.
  - High ROIC normally attracts competition; returns revert to cost of capital.
  - Firms sustaining high ROIC for 10–20 years possess structural entry barriers.

  3.1 Four Pillars of Structural Advantage
  - Analyst seeks evidence of moat, not generic qualities like management skill.

  3.1.1 Intangible Assets: Pricing Power Test
  - Intangibles are moats only when they increase willingness to pay.
  - Brands: Premium pricing (e.g., Tiffany) indicates moat; familiarity without premium (e.g., Sony) does not.
  - Patents: Strong when diversified enough that single expiry doesn’t collapse earnings; large pharma vs. single-drug biotech.
  - Regulatory Licenses: Government-granted monopolies (casinos, rating agencies). Assess political stability.

  3.1.2 Switching Costs: Lock-In Effect
  - High switching costs create inertia and pricing power.
  - Integration: Enterprise software (Oracle, SAP) embeds deeply; switching risks operational failure.
  - Procedural costs: Banking/asset management changes create “stickiness.”
  - Knowledge-based: Long training cycles (Autodesk) make retraining prohibitive.

  3.1.3 Network Effect: Virtuous Cycle
  - Value increases with user base; rare but strongest moat.
  - Aggregators: Visa/Mastercard, eBay—buyer–seller flywheel leads to winner-take-all dynamics.
  - Closed Loop Systems: Windows in 90s locked in developers, reinforcing dominance.

  3.1.4 Cost Advantages: Efficiency Moat
  - Structural cost edge enables underpricing rivals or earning superior margins.
  - Process: Operational innovations (Southwest, Dell) help but can be copied over time.
  - Scale: Large distribution networks (UPS, Coca-Cola) spread fixed costs widely.
  - Niche Dominance: High transport-cost sectors (cement, gravel) give local producer monopoly power.

  3.2 False Positives: Mistaken Moats
  - Great products: temporary success; easily commoditized without moat.
  - High market share: not durable; tech shifts erased leaders like Kodak, Netscape.
  - Great execution: operational efficiency is replicable; not structural.
  - Great management: not a moat; structural advantage must persist beyond leadership.
    Part IV. Qualitative Analysis: Growth Engine
    4.0 Overview
  - After safety and structural durability, assess long-term growth ability via Fisher’s Scuttlebutt method.
  - Qualitative analysis examines human, organizational, and operational realities influencing compounding.

  4.1 Scuttlebutt Methodology
  - Gather info from non-management sources to build an outside-in mosaic.
  - Competitors: Ask which competitor they would buy and why; reveals respected players.
  - Suppliers/Customers: Indicate payment reliability, negotiation fairness, and product demand trends.
  - Former Employees: Reveal culture, integrity, morale; high turnover or bitterness signals risk.

  4.2 Fisher’s Fifteen Qualitative Points
  - Checklist to identify long-term compounders.
  - Market Potential: Product must support multi-year sales growth; long runway essential.
  - Management Determination: Commitment to developing new products/processes beyond current drivers.
  - R&D Effectiveness: Evaluate yield of profitable products, not absolute spend.
  - Sales Organization: Strong sales force needed to monetize product advantages.
  - Profit Margins: Must be robust to survive adversity and fund R&D.
  - Margin Maintenance: Seek pricing power, efficiency improvements, not one-time cuts.
  - Labor Relations: Stable, satisfied workforce reduces costly disruptions.
  - Executive Relations: Cohesive leadership team; internal promotion fosters loyalty.
  - Management Depth: Avoid key-man risk; verify succession planning.
  - Cost Analysis: Strong cost controls and profit tracking support efficient capital allocation.
  - Industry Position: Identify special advantages tied to industry specifics (location, leases, insurance).
  - Long-Term Outlook: Preference for firms prioritizing long-term customer goodwill over short-term profit.
  - Financing Growth: Growth should rely on internal cash flow or prudent leverage; avoid dilutive equity issuance.
  - Candor: Value transparent communication, especially during adversity.
  - Integrity: Non-negotiable; unreliable management invalidates analysis.

  4.3 Management Factor: Capital Stewardship
  - Assess whether management allocates capital prudently.
  - Capital Allocation: Evaluate reinvestment discipline—moat-widening vs. diworsification.
  - Shareholder Orientation: Fair compensation, avoidance of needless dilution, partnership mindset.

  Part V. Synthesis: Strategic Selection Workflow

  5.0 Overview
  - Integrate Graham’s safety, Dorsey’s structural durability, and Fisher’s growth.

  5.1 Unified Selection Funnel

  Phase 1: Quantitative Exclusion (Safety Filter)
  - Remove firms with Interest Coverage <3×.
  - Remove firms with P/E >25× unless growth >20% for 5+ years.
  - Remove firms with negative earnings in any of past 5 years.

  Phase 2: Structural Verification (Moat Filter)
  - Confirm ROIC > WACC for 10 consecutive years.
  - Identify moat source: Switching Costs, Network Effect, Cost Advantage, Intangibles; if unnamed, assume no moat.

  Phase 3: Qualitative Audit (Growth Filter)
  - Conduct Scuttlebutt; verify Fisher’s 15 points.
  - Check management integrity via annual report history; look for admitted mistakes.

  5.2 Valuation: Determining Entry Point
  - Graham Baseline: Compute EPV assuming zero growth; ideal entry if price ≈ EPV.
  - Growth Premium: Wide Moat + High Growth can justify modest premium; still require Margin of Safety.

  5.3 Portfolio Construction
  - Synthesis: Concentrate (10–15 stocks) where qualitative conviction is highest; diversify broadly (20–30 names) for Net-Net/statistical value positions.
  - Cash acts as volatility option; hold if no qualifying opportunities.

  5.4 Psychology of Holding
  - Patience needed for Fisher compounders and Graham mean reversion.
  - Contrarianism required; strong opportunities appear when sentiment is fearful.

  Conclusion: Long-Term Discipline
  - Successful investing demands forensic analysis (Graham), structural insight (Dorsey), and investigative qualitative work (Fisher).
  - Margin of Safety + Moat + Quality Growth protects against permanent loss and mediocrity.

  Appendix A: Financial Safety Checklist
  - Earnings Stability: 10-year history; no deficit years.
  - Earnings Growth: 3-year avg (end vs. start); ≥33% increase over 10 years.
  - Financial Strength: Current Ratio >1.5× (industrial), >2× (conservative).
  - Asset Protection: Price/Tangible Book <1.5× (adjust for ROIC).
  - Debt Load: Long-term debt < Working Capital.
  - Dividend Record: Continuous payments for ≥20 years.

  Appendix B: Moat Identification Matrix

  Intangible Assets
  - Indicator: Premium pricing (e.g., Tiffany).
  - False Positive: Familiar brand without pricing power (e.g., Sony).

  Switching Costs
  - Indicator: Workflow integration; high retraining cost (e.g., Adobe).
  - False Positive: Long contracts for commodity products.

  Network Effect
  - Indicator: Value increases with user density (e.g., Visa, eBay).
  - False Positive: Scale mistaken for network (e.g., Wal‑Mart).

  Cost Advantage
  - Indicator: Structural process or location edge (quarry, pipeline).
  - False Positive: Cheap labor or temporary tech lead.

  Appendix C: Expanded Scuttlebutt Interview Guide

  Competitors
  - Which competitor would you invest in and why?
  - What advantage is hardest to replicate?
  - Are they becoming more aggressive in pricing or product launches?

  Suppliers
  - Payment reliability; fairness in negotiations.
  - Order-volume trends vs. peers.

  Customers
  - Reaction to 5% price increase; test brand/switching costs.
  - Sales team responsiveness.

  Appendix E: Valuation Methodologies

  Net-Net (Graham)
  - Liquidation Value = Cash + 0.75×Receivables + 0.50×Inventory − Total Liabilities.
  - Action: Buy if Market Cap < Liquidation Value.

  GARP (Fisher/Dorsey)
  - Require Wide Moat and Fisher-quality.
  - Normalize earnings; apply growth-compatible multiple.
  - Avoid perfection pricing; avoid P/E >30.

  ROIC Check (Dorsey)
  - ROIC = NOPAT / Invested Capital.
  - Action: Invest only if ROIC > WACC for ≥5 consecutive years.
